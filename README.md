Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` runs the automation described in the 4 steps mentioned in the above file. 

The output of the 4th step is called `tidyAveragesData.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
